// A partial:
// You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files.
//  This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.
// A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss.
// The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file.
// Sass partials are used with the @use rule.

$light-color: #f4f4f4;
$font-stack: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #0e6cff;
// $primary-color: #e0ffff;
$secondary-color: #ff8700;

// CREARING A FUNCTION
//set text color based on bg
//the function takes in the color of bg and on the basis its lightness returns corresponding black or white color

@function setTextColor($color) {
  @if (lightness($color) > 70) {
    @return #333;
  } @else {
    @return #fff;
  }
  //variables are defined using $
  //keywords are defined using @
}

// CREATING A MIXIN
// A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site.
// syntax is like a function, but it doesn't return anything

@mixin setBackground($color) {
  background-color: $color; // eg light-blue
  color: setTextColor($color); // setTextColor(light-blue)- returns dark color

  // grouping bg and text color
}
